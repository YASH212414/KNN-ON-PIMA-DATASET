# KNN-ON-PIMA-DATASET
 k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm on the Pima Indians Diabetes Database, often used for classification tasks. The Pima Indians Diabetes Database is a well-known dataset that contains various health-related features such as glucose levels, insulin levels, and other health metrics, along with a target variable indicating whether a patient has diabetes or not.
 
 Using KNN on this dataset involves:
 
1. Understanding the Dataset: Familiarize yourself with the dataset's features, target variable, and any preprocessing steps needed (such as handling missing values or scaling features).
2. Splitting the Dataset: Divide the dataset into training and testing sets. This helps evaluate the model's performance on unseen data.
Choosing k: Select an appropriate value for the hyperparameter k, which determines the number of neighbors to consider when making predictions. This can be done using techniques like cross-validation.
3. Training the Model: Fit the KNN model to the training data.
4. Making Predictions: Use the trained model to make predictions on the testing data.
5. Evaluating Performance: Assess how well the model performs on the testing data using evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, or ROC curves.
